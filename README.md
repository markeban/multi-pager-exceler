PHP Example Striping Specific Data from Multiple Excel Spreadsheets

This project involved striping hundred of excel spreadsheets and counting every time a certain cell had the numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, 41, 43, 50, 60, 222, 226, 230, 240, 244, and 246. Since the numbers were manually entered by person, each extracted cell string was trimmed to disregard spaces. These were also older .xls excel files, so PHP-ExcelReader was a perfect fit. I looked at a number of examples online, and didnâ€™t find exactly what I needed.

This was a bit a code to satify a very particular need, but if anyone can find this useful, or have tips on more efficent ways to accomplish the same thing, feel free to take, add, or contribute.
